# Nuxt Project Governance

# Overview

Nuxt is an "Open Source" (MIT Licensed) and "Independent" project made to profit all users equally.

Nuxt project is led by a project lead and the community's direct involvement. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the authors. In case of disagreement, they have the last word with mutual agreement. It is the project lead’s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project can progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community’s job to guide the decisions of the project leader through active engagement and contribution.

# Roles and Responsibilities

## Founders and Authors

Sébastien Chopin and Alexandre Chopin, the initial founders and authors of the project will keep being involved in the project's vision. In many ways, the role of the founders is about diplomacy and ensuring that the project survives in the long term. Pooya Parsa joined them later as the new author of the project by making multiple valuable contributions to the project. It is the author's responsibility to set strategic objectives for the project and communicate these clearly to the community.

## Project Lead

Pooya Parsa, one of the project authors, serves as the project lead of Nuxt. The project lead has the final say in all aspects of decision-making within the project as long as they are aligned with the project's vision and strategy. However, because the community always can fork, this person is fully answerable to the community. He also has to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project grows in the long term.

## The Framework Team

Members of the framework team are contributors who have made multiple valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role, for example, community engagement. Typically, a framework team member will focus on a specific aspect of the project and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of a framework team member is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the project lead looks to them for guidance and support.

Framework team members have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the project lead. It is a framework team member’s job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community’s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, framework team members are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code. That is, although framework team members do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the lead.

The framework team has the exclusive responsibility of maintaining `nuxt/` GitHub repositories and `@nuxt/` npm scoped packages.

## Community contributors

Contributors are community members that make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. Contributors engage with the project through communication tools, such as discussions and issues. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements, and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

- Supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective new user support)
- Reporting bugs
- Identifying requirements
- Supplying graphics and web design
- Programming
- Assisting with project infrastructure
- Writing documentation
- Fixing bugs
- Adding features

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the project lead starts relying on them more and more. When this begins to happen, they gradually adopt the role of a framework team member, as described above.

Community contributors usually will gain the responsibility of maintaining some `nuxt-community/` GitHub repositories and `@nuxtjs/` npm scoped packages.

## Community Partners

Some contributors, although not providing regular technical contributions, enrich the wider project ecosystem by doing some of the following:

- Organizing community conferences, meetups, and other social activities
- Developing important higher-level libraries and frameworks on top of the project
- Translating documentation into different languages
- Authoring high-quality educational materials
- Curating community resources

Community partners must keep in touch with the framework team to keep aligned with best practices and marketing strategies. A bi-weekly meeting is at least set to make this possible.

## Users

Users are community members who use the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- evangelizing about the project
- informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user’s perspective
- providing moral support (a ‘thank you goes a long way)
- providing financial support

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above.

# Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognize that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a vendor. (Of course, that vendor should be an active member of the community.) However, for those willing to engage with the project on its terms, and willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal.

## Monetary Donations

For an open development project, money is less important than active contribution. However, some people or organizations are cash-rich and time-poor and would prefer to make their contribution in the form of cash. If you want to make a significant donation, you may be able to sponsor us to implement a new feature or fix some bugs. The project website provides clear guidance on how to go about donating.

## Enterprise Partners

If you run a business using the project as a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor its development. It ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in our community and makes it easier to attract new developers.

Communication and support happen within [NuxtLabs](https://nuxtlabs.com) with the mandatory observation of the Framework team.

It is important to note that while by being an Enterprise Partner, we respect opinions to make a mutually solid ecosystem of integrations and usually share early access to ideas and projects, it doesn't give partners any right to push Framework's direction, marketing, or any kind of privilege for access unless it is decided to be needed by sole decision of Framework team.

# Branding

Nuxt Project is mainly branded as "Nuxt" with alternative variations of "Nuxt.js" and "NuxtJS".

"NuxtJS" is a [registered brand](https://relationshipscience.com/organization/nuxtjs-288590683) by [NuxtLabs](https://nuxtlabs.com). While it is preferred to avoid "NuxtJS" in all media and avoid confusion, Any reference to "NuxtJS" (accidental or similarity) does not mean any connection, relationship, or ownership.

# Processes

## Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the project discussions and issue tracking or might supply pull requests. The various ways of contributing are described in more detail in our **contribution guide**.

## Decision-Making Process

Major changes to the framework, especially breaking changes, are usually communicated ahead of time to the community via the RFC process.
The RFC process provides an opportunity for the community to provide feedback in the design process and allows the authors, the project lead, and framework team members to better gauge user needs.

It is, however, important to note that the RFC process does not hold any authority in terms of decision-making. In case of disagreements, the authors have the last word with mutual agreement. If the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a framework team member, the project lead can review their decisions by checking the relevant GitHub discussions, and either uphold or reverse them.
