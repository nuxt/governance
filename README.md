# Nuxt Project Governance

## Overview

Nuxt is an independent, open source (MIT licensed) framework for building web applications. There are many separate parts to the project, including the Nuxt web framework itself, official modules and core libraries, as well as a broad ecosystem of contribution and collaboration.

Within the project and community, there are a number of key people and roles who all need to work together for the project's ongoing success.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Authors

Sébastien Chopin and Alexandre Chopin founded the project and retain ultimate responsibility for the project's governance and direction. Pooya Parsa is also a key author of Nuxt due to his multiple valuable contributions to the project and significant role in the creation of Nuxt 3.

The authors continue to be involved with Nuxt by setting strategic objectives for the project, representing Nuxt in the community, and serving in an advisory role to the project lead.

### Project Lead

Daniel Roe serves as the current project lead of Nuxt.

The project lead is selected by the authors and can at any point be changed if there are issues with their leadership.

The project lead has the final say in all aspects of decision-making within the project as long as they are aligned with the strategic objectives set by the authors. This person is also fully answerable to the community. He also has to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project grows in the long term.

In many ways, the role of the project lead is about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind the vision of the project lead. The lead’s job is then to ensure that the core team members (see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally speaking, as long as the core team members are aligned with the project’s strategy, the project lead will allow them to proceed as they desire.

### The Core Team

Members of the core team are contributors who have made multiple valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role, for example community engagement. Typically, a core team member will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead.

It is a core team member’s job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community’s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, core team members are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code.

Core team members can be nominated by an existing core team member or the project lead. The nomination can only be approved by the project lead, after consulting the general consensus of the current core team members.

The core team has the responsibility of maintaining `nuxt/` GitHub repositories and `@nuxt/` npm scoped packages.

#### Core Team Emeritus

While a consistent presence is expected of core team members, sometimes a team member needs to step away from the project temporarily or wants to move away from the project entirely. This is not permanent. They can transition back into an active team role if they are able to take on those responsibilities again and have the approval of the team.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members that make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. Contributors engage with the project through communication tools, such as discussions and issues. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements, and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member performs one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

- Building features
- Fixing bugs
- Maintaining codebases
- Maintaining documentation
- Responding to issues
- Reviewing pull requests
- Supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective new user support)
- Speaking at events as a representative of their project(s)

Contributors will often gain the responsibility of maintaining some `nuxt-modules/` GitHub repositories and `@nuxtjs/` npm scoped packages.

### Community Partners

Some members of the community have enriched it so that they deserve special mention. As a result, they are recognized by the team as being Community Partners and we often coordinate with them on upcoming features and news.

They are usually individuals who have proven to provide long term and consistent value to the community. Through their work, the Nuxt team and/or project lead can nominate them to be invited as a Community Partner.

### Users

Users are community members who use the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- Evangelizing about the project
- Informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user’s perspective
- Providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way)
- Providing financial support

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved and may go on to become contributors.

## Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognize that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a vendor. (Of course, that vendor should be an active member of the community.) However, for those willing to engage with the project on its terms, and willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal.

### Monetary Donations

For an open development project, money is less important than active contribution. However, some people or organizations are cash-rich and time-poor and would prefer to make their contribution in the form of cash. If you want to make a significant donation, you may be able to sponsor us to implement a new feature or fix some bugs. The project website provides clear guidance on how to go about donating.

If you run a business using the project as a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor its development. It ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also improve exposure in our community and make it easier to attract new developers.

## Branding and Ownership

Nuxt has also been known in the past as "Nuxt.js" and "NuxtJS".

"NuxtJS" is a [registered brand](https://relationshipscience.com/organization/nuxtjs-288590683) by [NuxtLabs](https://nuxtlabs.com), the company run by Nuxt's founders.

NuxtLabs does not have any authority over the Nuxt project except that its founders are also the founders of Nuxt. Nevertheless, it continues to play a significant role in funding the project's development and building the ecosystem.

## Processes

### Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the project discussions and issue tracking or might supply pull requests. The various ways of contributing are described in more detail in our contribution guide.

### Decision-Making Process

Major changes to the framework, are usually communicated ahead of time to the community via the RFC process, issues or internally shared within the team.

The RFC process provides an opportunity for the community to provide feedback in the design process and allows the authors, the project lead, and core team members to better gauge user needs. It is, however, important to note that the RFC process does not hold any authority in terms of decision making.

In case of disagreements, the project lead does not need a formal conflict resolution process, since the project lead’s word is final. If the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a core team member, the project lead can review their decisions by checking the relevant GitHub discussions, and either uphold or reverse them.

At any point, if the authors disagree and want to discuss a decision, they can formally request a delay of any feature or decision until a conversation has taken place and concluded it is aligned with the objectives.

## Revisions

This document is signed-off by [Sébastien Chopin](https://github.com/Atinux), [Alexandre Chopin](https://github.com/alexchopin), and [Pooya Parsa](https://github.com/pi0) and any future changes should be unanimous approval from all.
